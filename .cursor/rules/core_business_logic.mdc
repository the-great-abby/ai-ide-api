# Core Business Logic Files (Backend)

This rule documents which files and modules are considered core business logic for the backend project. These files should be prioritized for testing, code review, and coverage.

## Key Directories & Files


## Guidance
- Prioritize these files for:
  - Unit and integration testing
  - Code coverage
  - Code review
- Update this rule as the codebase evolves or new business logic modules are added.
