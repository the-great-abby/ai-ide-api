# Container Editing Prohibition

**Rule:**  
All source code and configuration changes must be made on the host system, not inside running containers.

**Rationale:**  
- Ensures changes are tracked in version control.
- Maintains container immutability and reproducibility.
- Prevents loss of work when containers are rebuilt or removed.
- Aligns with [Docker's official best practices](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/best-practices/).

**How to comply:**  
- Edit files on your host machine.
- Use `docker compose up --build` or your Makefile targets to rebuild/restart containers after changes.
- Never use `vi`, `nano`, or similar editors inside a running container for project files.

**Examples:**
- ✅ Good: Edit `migrations/env.py` on your host, then run `make -f Makefile.ai ai-up`.
- ❌ Bad: Run `docker exec -it <container> vi /app/migrations/env.py` and edit inside the container.

**Enforcement:**  
This rule should be referenced in onboarding, code review, and troubleshooting documentation.
