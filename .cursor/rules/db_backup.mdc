# User Stories

- As a developer, before making major changes or performing destructive operations, I want to create a full backup of both the schema and data using the `ai-db-backup` target, so I can restore the entire database to its previous state if needed.
- As a developer, when I want to preserve just the data (and not the schema), I want to use the `ai-db-backup-data-only` target, so I can restore only the data after recreating or updating the schema.
- As a developer, to minimize confusion and maximize safety, I want a single command (`ai-db-backup-all`) that creates both full and data-only backups before any destructive operation.

# Best Practices

- Always take a backup before running destructive operations (e.g., drop, nuke, or major migrations).
- Use `ai-db-backup` for a full backup (schema + data).
- Use `ai-db-backup-data-only` for a data-only backup.
- Use `ai-db-backup-all` to create both types of backups for maximum flexibility.
- Store backups in a versioned, timestamped directory (e.g., `backups/`).
- Test restoring from backups periodically to ensure reliability.
- Document backup and restore procedures for onboarding and incident response.
- Regularly create new memory nodes for important lessons, best practices, and workflow changes, so the knowledge graph stays up to date for both humans and AI agents.
