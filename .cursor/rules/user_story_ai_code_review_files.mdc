# User Story

As a developer, I want to submit one or more files to the /review-code-files API endpoint for AI-assisted code review, so I can receive actionable feedback and rule suggestions before merging my changes.

# Acceptance Criteria
- I can POST one or more files to the /review-code-files endpoint.
- The system returns a list of suggestions and feedback for each file, generated by the AI reviewer.
- I can use this feedback to improve my code and propose new rules if needed.
- The workflow is documented and accessible via the CLI, Makefile, or UI.

# Example Workflow
1. Prepare the files you want to review.
2. Run:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:9103/review-code-files -F "files=@file1.py" -F "files=@file2.py"
   ```
   or use the Makefile target:
   ```bash
   make -f Makefile.ai ai-review-code-files FILE=yourfile.py
   ```
3. Review the AI-generated feedback and suggestions.
4. Optionally, propose new rules based on the feedback.
