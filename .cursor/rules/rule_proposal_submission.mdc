# Rule Proposal Submission Requirements

- **Overview**
  - All rule proposals must use the full template, including:
    - `reason_for_change`
    - `references`
    - `current_rule`
  - Proposals missing these fields will be rejected or flagged for revision.

- **Guidelines**
  - Provide a clear rationale for the change.
  - Link to related documentation, rules, or external resources in `references`.
  - Include the current rule or code pattern being replaced in `current_rule`.

- **Sample JSON**
