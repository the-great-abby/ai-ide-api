# User Story: Rule Details UI Readability Enhancement

> **Note:** For more specific workflow user stories and enhancement requests, see the `docs/user_stories/` directory referenced in project documentation and onboarding materials.

## As a human user
I want the rule details section (currently shown with white text on a grey background) to use a more readable and accessible color scheme
So that I can easily read and understand rule details without eye strain or accessibility issues

---

## Acceptance Criteria
- The rule details section in the UI should:
  - Use a color scheme with sufficient contrast between text and background (e.g., dark text on a light background, or light text on a dark but not mid-grey background).
  - Follow accessibility guidelines (e.g., WCAG AA/AAA contrast ratios).
  - Be easily readable for users with common forms of color blindness.
  - Be tested on both light and dark mode settings if supported.
- The change should be reviewed by at least one user for readability before deployment.

---

## Example Enhancement
- Change the rule details section from white text on grey to black or dark text on a light background, or use a lighter text color on a much darker background.
- Optionally, allow users to toggle between color schemes or inherit from system preferences.
