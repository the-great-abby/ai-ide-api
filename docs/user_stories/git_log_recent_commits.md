# User Story: Reviewing Recent Commits with Makefile Target

## Motivation
To streamline the process of reviewing recent code changes and enhancements, a Makefile target (`git-log-recent`) was added. This helps team members quickly audit recent activity, track enhancements, and support better communication and documentation of ongoing work.

## Actors
- Developers
- Project maintainers
- Reviewers

## Preconditions
- The project repository uses Git for version control.
- The `Makefile.ai` includes the `git-log-recent` target.
- Team members have access to the repository and Makefile.

## Step-by-Step Actions
1. A team member wants to review recent code changes (e.g., for daily standup, release notes, or code review).
2. They run the following command to see commits from the last 24 hours:
   ```bash
   make -f Makefile.ai git-log-recent
   ```
3. To customize the time window, they can specify the `SINCE` variable:
   ```bash
   make -f Makefile.ai git-log-recent SINCE='2 days ago'
   make -f Makefile.ai git-log-recent SINCE='3 hours ago'
   ```
4. The command outputs a concise summary of commits, including file changes and commit messages, for the specified time window.

## Expected Outcomes
- Team members can quickly see what has changed in the codebase over a given period.
- The process for reviewing recent commits is standardized and easy to remember.
- The team can more easily track enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes.

## Best Practices
- Use this target before meetings or releases to ensure everyone is aware of recent changes.
- Encourage all contributors to use descriptive commit messages for clarity.
- Reference this user story in onboarding and documentation to promote consistent usage.
